Configuration in this directory creates S3 bucket which demos such capabilities:
- static web-site hosting
- access logging (for S3 and ELB)
- versioning
- CORS
- lifecycle rules
- server-side encryption
- object locking

Please check [S3 replication example](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-s3-bucket/tree/master/examples/complete) to see Cross-Region Replication (CRR) supported by this module.

## Usage

To run this example you need to execute:

```bash
